"""
The program is trying to display the number of grades, the average grade, 
and the percentage of grades that are above the average grade in a final exam.
We first read in text file final.txt

Once the text file has been read into memory, we close the file.
The grades in text file will be imported to the program.
The program will read the input text file to assign the grades to a list of integer.

We then define a function that calculate the number of grades listed in the text file.
then, calculate the average grade which take the total grade(sum) / number of grades
then, we define a function that calculate the percentage of grades that are above the average grade (counter/length)
we format the output to float and add percentage

Print out the calculated values to the assigned variables.
